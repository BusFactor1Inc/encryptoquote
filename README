encryptoquote - a game of solving encrypted quotes
--------------------------------------------------

A command line game that often appears in the puzzle sections of
newspapers is one where you are given an encrypted quote and you are
asked to solve it given a single letter as a clue.  This game is
slightly harder, as you are not given a clue, but slightly easier as
you are given a few tools to help you with solving the puzzle. The
quotes are encrypted using a substitution cipher.

Type ? at the prompt to get some help.

Requirements
------------

To run encryptoquote you will need Python installed on your system.
On a Unix system you should just be able to type ./encryptoquote to
have it run (as long as your python is in /usr/bin). On windows, you
will have to type 'python.exe encryptoquote'.

Commands
--------

r - replace a letter of the encrypted puzzle with a letter in your
    solution
x - reset your solution to all blanks (_'s)
f - print a letter frequency table of the characters in the encrypted
    quote
n - print a table of letters that have not been used in the solution
q - print the solution and quit the program
? - this help

Hard Mode
---------

By passing --hard to the encryptoquote command, you can play the game
in 'hard mode'. All spaces and punctuation are removed from the
encrypted quote, just like the people at Bletchley Park had to deal
with. Good luck!

Quotes are scraped from www.quotationspage.com (without permission).

Server
------

Also included is a preliminary encryptoquote web server, which has all
the basics of setting up an encryptoquote page, without the ability to
solve the puzzle, since my web programming fu is not quite up to
completing that task (I'm not sure how to get input like from the
console).  Anybody willing to help complete this, go right ahead.

Bugs
----

- sometimes it hangs when getting a quote (probably due to the web
  server it is getting it from).  Simply ^C and start again.
